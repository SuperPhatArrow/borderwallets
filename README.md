Welcome to the Bitcoin Border Wallets repo.
Border Wallets offer Bitcoiners a way to quickly, easily, and reliably generate, memorise and recall Bitcoin wallet seed words.
Border Wallets are a new idea, so if you have not yet familiarised yourself with what they are or how they work with our Memory Maps generator tool,
please visit our website @ BorderWallets.com to learn about it.
If you have any ideas for how to make this project better and to reach more people, especially in our target demographic,
or if you would like to help or contribute to the project, we'd love to hear from you.


Gratitude to my co-conspirators

Thank you, SuperPhatArrow for your time, skills, insights and kind guidance, and BitcoinQNA for your encouragement, invaluable help and support.
